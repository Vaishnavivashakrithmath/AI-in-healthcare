 UTILIZING AI TO IMPROVE ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) REPORTING
-
## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI model for automating and improving the reporting of Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) . By analysing patient data and identifying patterns indicative 
of ADRs , the solution enhancing pharmacovigilance efforts , leading to safer drug usage and improve patient outcomes.


## Background

Adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) pose a significant public health issue , often leading to increased morbidity , mortality and healthcare costs.
Currently ADR reporting systems are mannual suffer from underreporting and inaccuracies. This project addressess the following problems:
*Low reporting rates of ADRs due to time constraints or lack of awareness..
*Inconsistent or incomplete data entries in ARD reports.
*Delays in identifying new or rare ADRs from large datasets.
*Also assist in identification of drug-drug interactions if any.


## How is it used?

The solution is designed for use by healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies . By integrating the model into electronic health record ( EHR ) systems,
clinicians can be alerted to potential ADRs during routine care . The AI tool processes patient history , medical lists and symptom reports to generate a comprehensive ADR
report.
  In addition , the AI model can assist pharmacovigilance teams by sifting through large databases to identify previously unreported ADRs , accelerating
  regulatory actions and safety updates.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data used for this project can be sourced from:
*Patient reported outcomes and electronic health records.
*Publicly available adverse event database , such as FDA Adverse event reporting system ( FAERS )

    The project employs natural language processing ( NLP ) techniques to extract information from unstructured text data and machine learning algorithms
    (e.g.. Random forest , support vactor machines ) to classify and predict potential ADRs.


## Challenges

The AI model may not capture all ADRs dur to limitations in available data or bias in the training datasets. Ethical considerations include ensuring patient privacy and maintaining the transparency
 of AI decisions in clinical settings.


## What next?

The project can be expanded by incorporating real - time monitoring of patient data to detect ADRs as they occur . Collaboration with healthcare institutions and regulatory bodies would be needed
for broader implementation. Additionally , improving the model with diverse datasets can increase its generalizability.
